        abstract = {The computation of the Tukey depth, also called halfspace depth, is very demanding, even in low dimensional spaces, because it requires that all possible one-dimensional projections be considered. A random depth which approximates the Tukey depth is proposed. It only takes into account a finite number of one-dimensional projections which are chosen at random. Thus, this random depth requires a reasonable computation time even in high dimensional spaces. Moreover, it is easily extended to cover the functional framework. Some simulations indicating how many projections should be considered depending on the kind of problem, sample size and dimension of the sample space among others are presented. It is noteworthy that the random depth, based on a very low number of projections, obtains results very similar to those obtained with the Tukey depth.}

        abstract="In 1975 John Tukey proposed a multivariate median which is the `deepest' point in a given data cloud in ℝd. Later, in measuring the depth of an arbitrary point z with respect to the data, David Donoho and Miriam Gasko considered hyperplanes through z and determined its `depth' by the smallest portion of data that are separated by such a hyperplane. Since then, these ideas have proved extremely fruitful. A rich statistical methodology has developed that is based on data depth and, more general, nonparametric depth statistics. General notions of data depth have been introduced as well as many special ones. These notions vary regarding their computability and robustness and their sensitivity to reflect asymmetric shapes of the data. According to their different properties they fit to particular applications. The upper level sets of a depth statistic provide a family of set-valued statistics, named depth-trimmed or central regions. They describe the distribution regarding its location, scale and shape. The most central region serves as a median. The notion of depth has been extended from data clouds, that is empirical distributions, to general probability distributions on ℝd, thus allowing for laws of large numbers and consistency results. It has also been extended from d-variate data to data in functional spaces.",

Classification of tissue samples can be a valuable diagnostic tool for diseases such as cancer. Clustering samples or experiments may lead to the discovery of subclasses of diseases. Clustering genes can help identify groups of genes that respond similarly to a set of experimental conditions. We also need validation tools for clustering and classification. Here, we focus on the identification of outliers—units that may have been misallocated, or mislabeled, or are not representative of the classes or clusters. We present two new methods: DDclust and DDclass, for clustering and classification. These non-parametric methods are based on the intuitively simple concept of data depth. We apply the methods to several gene expression and simulated data sets. We also discuss a convenient visualization and validation tool—the relative data depth plot.}

This paper investigates the possible use of different notions of data depth in non-parametric discriminant analysis. First, we consider the situation where the prior probabilities of the competing populations are all equal and investigate classifiers that assign an observation to the population with respect to which it has the maximum location depth. We propose a different depth-based classification technique for unequal prior problems, which is also useful for equal prior cases, especially when the populations have different scatters and shapes. We use some simulated data sets as well as some benchmark real examples to evaluate the performance of these depth-based classifiers. Large sample behaviour of the misclassification rates of these depth-based non-parametric classifiers have been derived under appropriate regularity conditions.},

Our analysis shows that some of the depth functions available in the literature have degenerate behaviour for some commonly used probability distributions in infinite dimensional spaces of sequences and functions. As a consequence, they are not very useful for the analysis of data satisfying such infinite dimensional probability models.

A Bahadur-type asymptotic linear representation and the associated weak convergence results for the sample spatial quantiles in infinite dimensional spaces are derived.

We address both one-step-ahead forecasting and dynamic updating. Dynamic updating is a forward prediction of the unobserved segment of the most recent curve. Among the two proposed methods, the first one is a straightforward adaptation to FTS of the k-nearest neighbors methods for univariate time series forecasting. The second one is based on a selection of curves, termed the curve envelope, that aims to be representative in shape and magnitude of the most recent functional observation, either a whole curve or the observed part of a partially observed curve. In a similar fashion to k-nearest neighbors and other projection methods successfully used for time series forecasting, we “project” the k-nearest neighbors and the curves in the envelope for forecasting. In doing so, we keep track of the next period evolution of the curves. The methods are applied to simulated data, daily electricity demand, and NOx emissions and provide competitive results with and often superior to several benchmark predictions. The approach offers a model-free alternative to statistical methods based on FTS modeling to study the cyclic or seasonal behavior of many FTS.}

        abstract = {The problem of estimating missing fragments of curves from a functional sample has been widely considered in the literature. However, most reconstruction methods rely on estimating the covariance matrix or the components of its eigendecomposition, which may be difficult. In particular, the estimation accuracy might be affected by the complexity of the covariance function, the noise of the discrete observations, and the poor availability of complete discrete functional data. We introduce a non-parametric alternative based on depth measures for partially observed functional data. Our simulations point out that the benchmark methods perform better when the data come from one population, curves are smooth, and there is a large proportion of complete data. However, our approach is superior when considering more complex covariance structures, non-smooth curves, and when the proportion of complete functions is scarce. Moreover, even in the most severe case of having all the functions incomplete, our method provides good estimates; meanwhile, the competitors are unable. The methodology is illustrated with two real data sets: the Spanish daily temperatures observed in different weather stations and the age-specific mortality by prefectures in Japan. They highlight the interpretability potential of the depth-based method.},

        abstract = {Functional data are traditionally assumed to be observed on the same domain. Motivated by a data set of heart rate temporal profiles, we develop methodology for the analysis of incomplete functional samples where each curve may be observed on a subset of the domain and unobserved elsewhere. We formalize this observation regime and develop the fundamental procedures of functional data analysis for this framework: estimation of parameters (mean and covariance operator) and principal component analysis. Principal scores of a partially observed function cannot be computed directly and we solve this challenging issue by estimating their best predictions as linear functionals of the observed part of the trajectory. Next, we propose a functional completion procedure that recovers the missing part by using the observed part of the curve. We construct prediction intervals for principal scores and bands for missing parts of trajectories. The prediction problems are seen to be ill-posed inverse problems; regularization techniques are used to obtain a stable solution. A simulation study shows the good performance of our methods. We illustrate the methods on the heart rate data and provide practical computational algorithms and theoretical arguments and proofs of all results.},

In functional data analysis, we observe curves defined over a given real interval and shape outliers may be defined as those curves that exhibit a different shape from the rest of the sample. Whereas magnitude outliers, that is, curves that lie outside the range of the majority of the data, are in general easy to identify, shape outliers are often masked among the rest of the curves and thus difficult to detect. In this article, we exploit the relationship between two measures of depth for functional data to help to visualize curves in terms of shape and to develop an algorithm for shape outlier detection. We illustrate the use of the visualization tool, the outliergram, through several examples and analyze the performance of the algorithm on a simulation study. Finally, we apply our method to assess cluster quality in a real set of time course microarray data.}",

For functional data the study of outlier detection has started only recently, and was mostly limited to univariate curves {\$}{\$}(p=1){\$}{\$}. In this paper we set up a taxonomy of functional outliers, and construct new numerical and graphical techniques for the detection of outliers in multivariate functional data, with univariate curves included as a special case. Our tools include statistical depth functions and distance measures derived from them. The methods we study are affine invariant in {\$}{\$}p{\$}{\$}-dimensional space, and do not assume elliptical or any other symmetry.},
