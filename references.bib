Classification of tissue samples can be a valuable diagnostic tool for diseases such as cancer. Clustering samples or experiments may lead to the discovery of subclasses of diseases. Clustering genes can help identify groups of genes that respond similarly to a set of experimental conditions. We also need validation tools for clustering and classification. Here, we focus on the identification of outliers—units that may have been misallocated, or mislabeled, or are not representative of the classes or clusters. We present two new methods: DDclust and DDclass, for clustering and classification. These non-parametric methods are based on the intuitively simple concept of data depth. We apply the methods to several gene expression and simulated data sets. We also discuss a convenient visualization and validation tool—the relative data depth plot.}

This paper investigates the possible use of different notions of data depth in non-parametric discriminant analysis. First, we consider the situation where the prior probabilities of the competing populations are all equal and investigate classifiers that assign an observation to the population with respect to which it has the maximum location depth. We propose a different depth-based classification technique for unequal prior problems, which is also useful for equal prior cases, especially when the populations have different scatters and shapes. We use some simulated data sets as well as some benchmark real examples to evaluate the performance of these depth-based classifiers. Large sample behaviour of the misclassification rates of these depth-based non-parametric classifiers have been derived under appropriate regularity conditions.},

In this work, we prove some Glivenko-Cantelli and Donsker-type results for the empirical spatial distribution process in infinite dimensional spaces. The spatial quantiles in such spaces can be obtained by inverting the spatial distribution function. A Bahadur-type asymptotic linear representation and the associated weak convergence results for the sample spatial quantiles in infinite dimensional spaces are derived. A study of the asymptotic efficiency of the sample spatial median relative to the sample mean is carried out for some standard probability distributions in function spaces. The spatial distribution can be used to define the spatial depth in infinite dimensional Banach spaces, and we study the asymptotic properties of the empirical spatial depth in such spaces. We also demonstrate the spatial quantiles and the spatial depth using some real and simulated functional data.},

This problem arises naturally in various applications, and there are many methods available in the literature. Based on data depth, several tests have been proposed for this problem but they may not be very powerful. In light of the recent development of data depth as an important measure in quality assurance, we propose two new test statistics for the multivariate two-sample homogeneity test. The proposed test statistics have the same &chi;2(1) asymptotic null distribution. The generalization of the proposed tests into the multivariate multisample situation is discussed as well. Simulations studies demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed tests. The test procedure is illustrated through two real data examples.},

        abstract = {Local depth is a generalization of ordinary depth able to reveal local features of the probability distribution. Liu's simplicial depth is primarily used, but results for Tukey's halfspace depth are also derived. It is shown that the maximizers of local depth can help to detect the mode(s) of a probability distribution. This work is devoted to the univariate case, but the main definitions are stated in the general multivariate case. Theoretical results and applications are illustrated with several examples.}

        abstract = {Two nonparametric methods are presented for forecasting functional time series (FTS). The FTS we observe is a curve at a discrete-time point. We address both one-step-ahead forecasting and dynamic updating. Dynamic updating is a forward prediction of the unobserved segment of the most recent curve. Among the two proposed methods, the first one is a straightforward adaptation to FTS of the k-nearest neighbors methods for univariate time series forecasting. The second one is based on a selection of curves, termed the curve envelope, that aims to be representative in shape and magnitude of the most recent functional observation, either a whole curve or the observed part of a partially observed curve. In a similar fashion to k-nearest neighbors and other projection methods successfully used for time series forecasting, we “project” the k-nearest neighbors and the curves in the envelope for forecasting. In doing so, we keep track of the next period evolution of the curves. The methods are applied to simulated data, daily electricity demand, and NOx emissions and provide competitive results with and often superior to several benchmark predictions. The approach offers a model-free alternative to statistical methods based on FTS modeling to study the cyclic or seasonal behavior of many FTS.}

        abstract = {The problem of estimating missing fragments of curves from a functional sample has been widely considered in the literature. However, most reconstruction methods rely on estimating the covariance matrix or the components of its eigendecomposition, which may be difficult. In particular, the estimation accuracy might be affected by the complexity of the covariance function, the noise of the discrete observations, and the poor availability of complete discrete functional data. We introduce a non-parametric alternative based on depth measures for partially observed functional data. Our simulations point out that the benchmark methods perform better when the data come from one population, curves are smooth, and there is a large proportion of complete data. However, our approach is superior when considering more complex covariance structures, non-smooth curves, and when the proportion of complete functions is scarce. Moreover, even in the most severe case of having all the functions incomplete, our method provides good estimates; meanwhile, the competitors are unable. The methodology is illustrated with two real data sets: the Spanish daily temperatures observed in different weather stations and the age-specific mortality by prefectures in Japan. They highlight the interpretability potential of the depth-based method.},

        abstract = {Functional data are traditionally assumed to be observed on the same domain. Motivated by a data set of heart rate temporal profiles, we develop methodology for the analysis of incomplete functional samples where each curve may be observed on a subset of the domain and unobserved elsewhere. We formalize this observation regime and develop the fundamental procedures of functional data analysis for this framework: estimation of parameters (mean and covariance operator) and principal component analysis. Principal scores of a partially observed function cannot be computed directly and we solve this challenging issue by estimating their best predictions as linear functionals of the observed part of the trajectory. Next, we propose a functional completion procedure that recovers the missing part by using the observed part of the curve. We construct prediction intervals for principal scores and bands for missing parts of trajectories. The prediction problems are seen to be ill-posed inverse problems; regularization techniques are used to obtain a stable solution. A simulation study shows the good performance of our methods. We illustrate the methods on the heart rate data and provide practical computational algorithms and theoretical arguments and proofs of all results.},
