        Outliergram for the NMR spectra of 40 wine samples.
        The three purple curves have been identified as shape outliers, as
        they fall outside the orange ribbon in the outliergram.
        Although the red curves lie on the orange parabola, they have low MBD
        and extreme MEI values, indicating that they lie above or below the
        main mass of curves.
